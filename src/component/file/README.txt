Please make sure to place this file in the root folder of your project so that the KoreanCheck builder can function properly.

If you encounter any issues while using it, please reach out to us at https://github.com/dukbong/Korean_Hunting_Back, and we'll be happy to assist you.

The provided script already includes both 'clean' and 'build' commands, so there's no need to perform them separately.

Currently, if there are Korean characters in your source code, you'll be prompted with "Y/N" to decide whether to proceed with the build.

Thank you.
